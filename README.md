## Thoughts for Future Improvements

- Ability to block users
- Consider deeper connection to external APIs (for reviews, etc.)
- Add a history of watched items
- Import ratings/history from streaming services if possible
- Create cloud player or other system to allow friends to share streaming-services (unless this is illegal)
- Create parent filters
- Support multiple languages
- Understand what is available based on current location (since streaming availability can depend on region)
